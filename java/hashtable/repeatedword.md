 ## test
 [ test ](./app/src/test/java/hashtable/AppTest.java)  

## Approach & Efficiency
Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
