# Movie Sorting Program

## Overview
This program is designed to sort an array of Movie objects based on two criteria: most recent year and alphabetical title, while ignoring leading "A", "An", or "The". It provides two sorting functions to achieve these tasks.

- `sortByMostRecentYear(movies)`: Sorts movies by the most recent year first.
- `sortByTitle(movies)`: Sorts movies alphabetically by title, ignoring leading "A", "An", or "The".

## How to Use
1. Include the sorting functions in  Java project.
2. Provide an array of Movie objects as input to these functions.
3. The sorted array will be returned based on the chosen criteria.
